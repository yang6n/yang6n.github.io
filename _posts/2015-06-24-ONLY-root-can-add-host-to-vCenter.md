I have a Host running on EXSi 5.1.0, a vCenter 5.5 running on it.

I had this problem for few days, googled lots of article, it's turned out: ONLY root account can add host into VMware cluster. 

```
License file download from standalone host 000.000.000.00 to vCenter Server failed due to exception: vim.fault.HostConnectFault.
```
